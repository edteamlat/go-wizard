# ðŸ§™ Go Wizard

Is a command line interface that provides you with useful commands to help you build your application with the Hexagonal
Architecture. It allows you to generate the initial structure of a project and to generate every layer of a new package.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

1. Create the initial structure of a project âœ…
2. Create a package on the different layers âœ…
3. Add one field on the desired layers (database, model, storage, etc.) WIP ðŸ› 
4. Remove one field on the desired layers (database, model, storage, etc.) WIP ðŸ› 
5. Override a package WIP ðŸ› 

## âš™ Installation

This command will install the CLI on $GOPATH/bin so make sure that you have that on your $PATH.

```bash
go install github.com/edteamlat/go-wizard@latest
```

If you want a different version, just replace the `@latest` with the version `@v1.0.0`

## ðŸ’» Usage

### Init command

To create the initial structure of a new project you just need to run the next command:

```bash
go-wizard init -m github.com/edteamlat/my-app
```

This will create the project on the current directory with the layers to work with the hexagonal architecture, and
it'll automatically init git and the go modules.

```bash
my-app
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ configuration.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ echo.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logger.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ remoteconfig.go
â”œâ”€â”€ domain
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handler
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ request
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fields.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ parameter.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ token.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ response
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ message.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ response.go
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ router.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ postgres
â”œâ”€â”€ model
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ error.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ filter.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logger.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ messagehandler.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model_test.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ remoteconfig.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ router.go
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ sqlmigration
â””â”€â”€ wizard-config.yaml
```
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:
```bash
cd my-app
```

Inside the created project, you must run the next command to install the dependencies:
```bash
go mod init
```

```bash
go-wizard help init
```

### Add package command
With this command you can create the CRUD on the available layers that will read from a config yaml file:
```yaml
# if you don't specify this field, the wizard will automatically use the path of working directory (pwd)
project_path: /home/username/Documents/code/

# the module_name is used to create the imports
module_name: github.com/edteamlat/go-wizzard

# Use for the name of the structs of the different layers
model: UserRole

# Will be use for the table name and constraints
# also, it'll be converted to camel case to be use
# for the Slice model
table: user_roles

# table_comment will be use as the comment for the new table
table_comment: Write your comment here

# a list of objects where you specify the name, type and if it allows nulls
# by default, the id, created_at and updated_at fields, will be added
fields:
  - name: user_id
    type: uint
    is_null: false
  - name: description
    type: string
    is_null: true
  - name: is_active
    type: bool
    is_null: false
  - name: begins_at
    type: time.Time
    is_null: false

# The available layers that we can generate
# if you don't want to use one, just remove it
layers:
  - domain
  - handler_echo # we only support the echo framework for now
  - storage_postgres # we don't support other db system for now
  - model
  - sqlmigration_postgres # here we'll save the sql files to modify our db, it only supports postgres syntax for now
```

This config file is added on the root of your project  with the name `wizard-config.yaml` when you exec the init command.

To create a new package just fill the config file and exec the next command:
```bash
go-wizard add package
```

With the config file of above this command will generate the following:
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”œâ”€â”€ domain
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ userrole
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ usecase.go
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ userrole.go
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handler
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ request
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ response
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ userrole
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handler.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ route.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ postgres
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ userrole
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ userrole.go
â”œâ”€â”€ model
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ userrole.go
â”œâ”€â”€ sqlmigration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 20210908_063849_create_user_roles_table.sql
```

Now you can enter into every file that was generated to see what's inside.
